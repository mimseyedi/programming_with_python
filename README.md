# Programming with Python

In this repository I have tried to explain Python step by step based on what I have learned in notebook files and teach this language with the help of workable examples.

## You need The Jupyter to run these files
- Download and install Jupyter using pip:
```
python -m pip install jupyter
```

- Also, if you are using Windows operating system, you can download and install the Anaconda package, which contains Jupyter, from the following link:
https://www.anaconda.com

## Guide
- All the files are named in order and by following them from the first lesson to the last lesson, you can go through the learning path correctly.
- There are exercises in the files that you can run or change the values and practice with.
- At the end of some files there are tasks that you can do to progress in learning them. If you do not find the tasks, you can do a Google search for them.
- All of this content is free and accessible for sharing.
